# Loan Approval Prediction 🏦  

##  Overview  
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The model analyzes applicant data (income, credit history, loan amount, etc.) and classifies loan approval status.  

##  Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Supervised learning model implementation  
- Model evaluation with accuracy score & confusion matrix  
- Loan status prediction on new applicant data  

##  Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)  

##  Key Learnings  
- Gained hands-on experience with **classification algorithms**  
- Improved understanding of **data preprocessing**  
- Learned how to evaluate and fine-tune ML models
